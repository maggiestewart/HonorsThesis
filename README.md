### Summary
For my honors thesis project, I plan to create a new website from scratch. I will be using the resources I learned while in my classes and internship, ranging from design (color palettes, fonts, layout, light/dark mode, etc.) to implementation to hosting on an AWS EC2 instance. I would like to create a new/modern library website for the East Baton Rouge Parish Library system since it was an impactful part of my childhood, spending my summers at a variety of programs, as well as my adolescence, where I worked as a Library Page prior to being employed at my most recent internship. 
<br><br>
I first will research design choices for the best User Interaction and Experience (UI/UX) by viewing and making notes of various library websites across the US. From this research, I will design and implement the layout of my website with functionality from scratch using Miro (Low-Fi design) and Figma (Hi-Fi design). To utilize popular programming languages, I will be using MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS to create the site, AWS/Amazon EC2 instance to host the site dynamically, and GitHub for code/task management.
